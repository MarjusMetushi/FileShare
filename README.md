# FileShare
FileShare is a Java project with a straight-forward GUI and implementation of a file sharing system.
# Concept
The concept of this project is to start a server, connect two clients to this server and allow these clients to store their files in the server, download and view them.
# Instructions
This project works in the following order
-Start the server class
-Start the clients
-Select a file/Folder
-Send the selected file/folder to the server
-Click The "Download" button in order to view and download the files
-After downloading a file/folder, it will appear in the desktop as a ZIP folder or if it's a file the format remains unchanged
-Possibility to download a file from the folder as needed because the folder gets sent separately before sent as a ZIP
